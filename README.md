Coursera Algoritms course programming assignments (100%)

##Week 1
Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.

##Week 2
Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

##Week 3
Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.

##Week 4
Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.

##Week 5 (coming soon)
Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point). 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval.
